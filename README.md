This project is inspired by my daughter's desire for interactive experiences. Drawing from the whimsical world of Alice in Wonderland, I set out to bring it to life in this project. And let's be real, those cat lovers out there often have conversations with their furry companions, so why not engage in a quiz with Cheshire and his adventures?

## My Process:
I brainstormed questions that would not only be easy but also offer fun facts and memorable takeaways. Realizing the need for variety, I crafted over 20 random questions to curate a dynamic 10-question quiz. To ensure accessibility, I designed it as a multiple-choice experience, suitable for users of all reading levels. And of course, I injected a cheeky fun factor, embodied by our mischievous host, Cheshire.

To accommodate the content flow, I structured the project into four main sections:
1. Introduction to the Quiz: Welcome users and introduce them to Cheshire and the adventure that awaits.
2. Quiz Questions: Present users with a series of questions, each with four possible answers, fostering interactive engagement.
3. Correct or Incorrect Responses: Provide feedback and encouragement based on user answers, along with tracking their score.
4. Final Score: Display the user's end score and offer the option to start the quiz anew.

## Background - Picture of Cheshire:
For the background image of Cheshire, I sourced a captivating graphic poster from [wallpapers.com](https://wallpapers.com/cheshire-cat-graphic-poster), credited to "miami22". The image depicts Cheshire lounging on a tree branch, reminiscent of the iconic scene from Alice in Wonderland where he first encounters Alice. It serves as a fitting visual for our cat-themed quiz project, intertwined with moments from the beloved Disney adaptation.

## Project Sources:
I leveraged various resources throughout the development of this Quiz Project:
- Video tutorials on quiz building. ![Quiz coding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riDzcEQbX6k&list=PLZlA0Gpn_vH_XnZHin-Vjma8KylU-N0X8&ab_channel=WebDevSimplified)
- Google Fonts for typography choices.
- Color palettes from design playbooks to ensure visual harmony.
- Favicon creation tool from ![favicon.io](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/).
- Community forums like ![FreeCodeCamp](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/) for troubleshooting and code inspiration.
- GPT - Helped write questions and text corrections.

## Responsive Design and Testing:
I prioritized responsiveness using tools like Lighthouse to ensure a seamless experience across devices. Addressing encountered issues such as upload speed optimization, JavaScript file organization, favicon integration, and refining class names and IDs for clarity were crucial steps in enhancing the project's performance and user experience.

## Problems:
During the project, I had used in the beginning a video which I had been given as a source to code from. After I asked for help to fix parts of the non-functioning code - I was told that it was a "well used code - from students" and it would in turn give me a "fail" for PP2.

Unfortunately with 3 working days left, I could not unsee the code I had been using. I have tried to use another variation, using var as a gobal usage. I had, although using an "overused-code" got to add more to my learning experience - freehand/freestyle even tho it had already been pre-written. - My deepest apologies there.

I do understand the word ####'Plagiarism'#### - I am quite certain noone without intent would do something that is not correct to harm their learning accomplishments - with completeing this course. I appreciate that there are mails from student-care in regard, as guidelines also in the online information.


And now with this said - even tho I had been using code taken from a video, which was given to me fom a teacher! I had no idea at this time that it would be called 'Plagiarism'. Again!, I found that, I had also a lot of learning experience using this code, watching this video.

I am sitting here with the last 48 hours, including nightshift work, adding in pieces which I hope will help me pass this part of the course. I ask you my project marker, please to be kind, that once I had seen how something works and started using it - it became hard to break away from. I know I could use if, else to accomplish the same result. I am afraid after seeing this well written, easy to see code that it started making more sense than to go back to let. Function is an interesting loop to use which is what java-script is about. It does the work - for the UI = user interface. And through my mishaps I realized there is more to java-script than I had taken away from the course content - which at the end of the day is our target, as students and teacher - also the course developers.
