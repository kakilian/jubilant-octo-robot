This project is inspired by my daughter's desire for interactive experiences. Drawing from the whimsical world of Alice in Wonderland, I set out to bring it to life in this project. And let's be real, those cat lovers out there often have conversations with their furry companions, so why not engage in a quiz with Cheshire and his adventures?

## My Process:
I brainstormed questions that would not only be easy but also offer fun facts and memorable takeaways. Realizing the need for variety, I crafted over 20 random questions to curate a dynamic 10-question quiz. To ensure accessibility, I designed it as a multiple-choice experience, suitable for users of all reading levels. And of course, I injected a cheeky fun factor, embodied by our mischievous host, Cheshire.

To accommodate the content flow, I structured the project into four main sections:
1. Introduction to the Quiz: Welcome users and introduce them to Cheshire and the adventure that awaits.
2. Quiz Questions: Present users with a series of questions, each with four possible answers, fostering interactive engagement.
3. Correct or Incorrect Responses: Provide feedback and encouragement based on user answers, along with tracking their score.
4. Final Score: Display the user's end score and offer the option to start the quiz anew.

## Background - Picture of Cheshire:
For the background image of Cheshire, I sourced a captivating graphic poster from [wallpapers.com](https://wallpapers.com/cheshire-cat-graphic-poster), credited to "miami22". The image depicts Cheshire lounging on a tree branch, reminiscent of the iconic scene from Alice in Wonderland where he first encounters Alice. It serves as a fitting visual for our cat-themed quiz project, intertwined with moments from the beloved Disney adaptation.

## Project Sources:
I leveraged various resources throughout the development of this Quiz Project:
- Video tutorials on quiz building. ![Quiz coding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riDzcEQbX6k&list=PLZlA0Gpn_vH_XnZHin-Vjma8KylU-N0X8&ab_channel=WebDevSimplified)
- Google Fonts for typography choices.
- Color palettes from design playbooks to ensure visual harmony.
- Favicon creation tool from ![favicon.io](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/).
- Community forums like ![FreeCodeCamp](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/) for troubleshooting and code inspiration.
- GPT - Helped write questions and text corrections.
- 

## Responsive Design and Testing:
I prioritized responsiveness using tools like Lighthouse to ensure a seamless experience across devices. Addressing encountered issues such as upload speed optimization, JavaScript file organization, favicon integration, and refining class names and IDs for clarity were crucial steps in enhancing the project's performance and user experience.

## Apology and Explanation Regarding Project Code Usage
During the project, I initially used a video provided to me as a source for coding. When I sought assistance to fix parts of the non-functioning code, I was informed that the code was "well-used by students" and could result in a fail for my PP2 project.

Unfortunately, with only three working days left, it was difficult to distance myself from the code I had been using. I attempted to make changes by using var for global usage. Despite working with "overused code," I still learned a lot by adding my own modifications and coding freestyle, even though the base code was pre-written. I deeply apologize for this.

I understand the seriousness of plagiarism and I assure you that I had no intention of compromising my learning achievements or the integrity of the course. I appreciate the guidelines provided by student care and the online information regarding this matter.

I want to clarify that I used the code from a video given to me by a teacher, unaware that it could be considered plagiarism. Despite this, I gained significant learning experience from using the code and watching the video.

With just 48 hours remaining, including working through the night, I have been diligently adding my own pieces to the project in the hope of passing this part of the course. I kindly ask for your understanding. Once I saw how certain parts of the code worked, it became challenging to break away from it. I know I could use 'if' and 'else' statements to achieve similar results. However, after seeing the well-written, easy-to-understand code, it made more sense to use it. Functions, which are fundamental to JavaScript, help create a seamless user interface (UI). Through my mistakes, I realized that JavaScript is more complex than I initially understood from the course content. Ultimately, our goal as students, teachers, and course developers is to deepen our understanding and mastery of the subject.
